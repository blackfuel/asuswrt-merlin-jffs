blackfuel / asuswrt-merlin-jffs
===============================

The Linux scripts and configuration files found here should be copied to the appropriate places in your router's /jffs folder.

Before proceeding, you must flash the Blackfuel fork of the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware to your router.  

I have enabled some Linux kernel features and added some pre-compiled programs to the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware that enables real-time disk encryption and high-precision time keeping.
