blackfuel / asuswrt-merlin-scripts
==================================

The Linux scripts and configuration files found here should be copied to the appropriate places in your router's /jffs folder.

These scripts require the Blackfuel version of Asuswrt-Merlin firmware to be flashed to your router.

I have enabled some Linux kernel features and added some pre-compiled programs to the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware that enables real-time disk encryption and high-precision time keeping.
